# SonarQube Fake Download Script

![Fake Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fake%20Download-Fun-blue)

This is a **fun** script that simulates the download and installation of SonarQube, SonarScanner, PostgreSQL, OpenJDK, Oracle JRE, and Nginx. The script displays a progress bar with random speeds to make it look like an actual download process.

## üöÄ How It Works
The script:
- Detects your operating system.
- Displays a message saying that SonarQube and other dependencies are being downloaded.
- Shows a progress bar that updates from 1% to 100%.
- Randomly simulates download speeds between **500KB/s and 1500KB/s**.
- Pretends that everything is successfully installed at the end.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This script does **NOT** actually download or install any software. It's purely for entertainment purposes!

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lalatenduswain/SonarQube-Download-Script/refs/heads/master/SonarQube.sh | bash

Or, manually run it after downloading:
```bash
